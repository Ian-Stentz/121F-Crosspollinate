# Devlog Entry #1 - 11/17/2024

## Introducing the Team
Carolyn Hope - Design Lead
Ian Stentz - Tools Lead
Lorraine Torres - Engine Lead
Chase Croy-Perrett - Design Assistant Lead

## Tools and Materials
We will be using Phaser as a 2D framework primarily because all our engineers have past experience with Phaser. Phaser’s modular structure would allow team members to focus on different aspects of the game (physics, graphics, or input handling) while maintaining smooth collaboration. Phaser 3 and its libraries also offer many built-in-tools for asset management, physics, and rendering, enabling quick prototyping and iteration. Phaser also provides extensive documentation to facilitate resource finding and troubleshooting, allowing our team to implement an efficient game.


We will be using Javascript with Phaser and JSON, as this will allow rapid development and deployment of the 2D web-based game we’re aiming to make for this project. Javascript and Phaser are tools all of us are familiar with, which will allow us to spend less time grappling with the engine and more time implementing features and ensuring the organization and memory-efficiency of our codebase. Finally, we hope to use JSON as a tool to manage different kinds of game objects and quickly add new ones to the project.  


We expect to use Visual Studio Code for code authoring throughout the project, and since Phaser allows the importing of 2D assets with extreme ease, we will use Paint.net - which Carolyn feels skilled in and will lead the rest of us on - for the creation of visual assets. If necessary, we will also be using Tiled if our game ends up needing a tiled world (it probably will be - given the theme), and it is both an easy tool to use and a familiar one, thanks to 120.


Our platform switch will be from javascript to typescript. We feel like this is a meaningful change because though we are keeping Phaser, which will help greatly with displaying images, typescript will require us to restructure our code - unlike, for example, how a change from typescript to javascript might go. We chose typescript because it is familiar to all of us, and the platform switch options with other common game engines like Unity seemed to go too obscure.

## Outlook
While other teams may focus on a simple farming simulator, we intend to focus on the act of creating new crops by cross-pollination. We anticipate that the most challenging part of the project will be to implement consistent formatting between code and clear documentation. We hope to learn how to implement the various design patterns and learn what development in Javascript looks like from beginning-to-end.
